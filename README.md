### **Managing Permissions with AWS IAM**  

**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** enables secure control over AWS resources by managing user identities, roles, and permissions. It follows the **principle of least privilege**, ensuring users and services only have necessary access.  

### **Key Features:**  
- **Users & Groups**: Manage individual and grouped access.  
- **Roles & Policies**: Define permissions using JSON-based policies.  
- **MFA & Access Keys**: Enhance security with multi-factor authentication.  

### **Best Practices:**  
- Use **IAM Roles** for applications instead of access keys.  
- Regularly review **permissions** and follow **least privilege**.  
- Enable **MFA** for added security.  

IAM helps secure AWS environments by enforcing fine-grained access controls across services.
